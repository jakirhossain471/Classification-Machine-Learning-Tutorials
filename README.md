Data-driven Methods for Sensor-less Condition Monitoring of Electric Drive-train from Phase Current Measurements
Electric drive-train e.g. electric motors are a vital component of electro-mechanical rotary systems. Real-time condition monitoring of these machine is a necessary requirements for most of the smart systems like electric vehicle. 
But it generally requires additional sensor installation which bring complexity and expanses. The goal of this work is to investigate whether it
is possible to do condition monitoring from external parameters
like phase currents and phase angle regardless of any additional
sensor installation except for regular volt-Ampere measurements.
The methods discussed in this work is data-driven and does
not require prior knowledge of the machine components. Thus
making the condition monitoring autonomous and sensor-less.
